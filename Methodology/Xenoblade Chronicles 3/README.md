# Xenoblade Chronicles 3

> Game info

TitleID: `010074F013262000`<br>
Explanation based on:
- Internal version: `1.3.0`, 
- Nintendo version ID: `v6`/`v393216`
- BID: `B76CD24AF02ACEA2`
- Engine: Monolith Soft proprietary engine (Rendering pipeline is called `DrPixlMan`)

> WARNING

- Cutscenes in final battle are not flagged by game as cutscenes, so they are rendered at 60 FPS and can crash game. Set game to 30 FPS through whole final battle if you don't want to risk repeating battle from the start.
- In Chapter 7 in many places collecting ether can crash game. It is advised to collect ether only at 30 FPS.

> Details

This game is using internal vsync signal detection set to 2, which means it skips every second frame. <br>
We need to change it to 1 to unlock >30 FPS. <br>
2D animations that are not particle effects are fixed to framerate, but they are tweaked for each FPS target.<br>
2D particle effects are not fixed to framerate, but they are using vsync to set their speed, so at above 30 FPS they are 2x faster.<br>
3D particle effects are fixed to framerate and there is not known offset to change their speed.<br>

Beside that cutscenes animations are either hardcoded to 30 FPS or not, but then they are glitching at higher framerates.<br>
That's why it's necessary to get an offset to determine if we are in cutscene or not to automatically lock to 30 FPS if cutscene is detected.<br>
Thanks to `Hazerou` for figuring out the most reliable offset for detecting cutscenes.

Game is also using double buffer. To disable it, turn off `Sync Wait` in FPSLocker. Expect some small graphical glitches because of dynamic resolution changes between frames.

DR is adjusted based on GPU work time. When game has overhead over GPU it increases resolution to the point, where RAM is bottlenecking game. But because this is not affecting GPU work time, game increases resolution at the cost of FPS. So without overclocking RAM above 1600 Mhz, OC GPU to 768 MHz can result in worse performance than 460 MHz.

# How to find offsets

We need to use disassembler in this case. 

> First we determine how to enable 60 FPS.

After finishing disassembling `main`, we need to find those bytes:
```
00 01 00 B9 2A 01 00 B9 C0 03 5F D6
```

Before them we will find instructions that are loading pointers to vsync signal detection values. Function looks something like this:
```asm
.text:0000007101157D18 sub_7101157D18                          ; CODE XREF: sub_7101192BC4+14â†“p
.text:0000007101157D18                 ADRP            X8, #off_7101A2EC28@PAGE
.text:0000007101157D1C                 LDR             X8, [X8,#off_7101A2EC28@PAGEOFF]
.text:0000007101157D20                 ADRP            X9, #off_7101A2EC50@PAGE
.text:0000007101157D24                 LDR             X9, [X9,#off_7101A2EC50@PAGEOFF]
.text:0000007101157D28                 LDR             W10, [X8]
.text:0000007101157D2C                 STR             W0, [X8]
.text:0000007101157D30                 STR             W10, [X9]
.text:0000007101157D34                 RET
.text:0000007101157D34 ; End of function sub_7101157D18
```

`off_7101A2EC28` stores one pointer `dword_7101A08F98`, so our first offset is `[MAIN, 0x1A08F98]`.<br>
`off_7101A2EC50` stores another pointer `dword_7101A08F9C`, so our second offset is `[MAIN, 0x1A08F9C]`

As they are stored one after another at the same size, we can use patch format in this way to write default values for 30 FPS and below:
```yaml
  -
    type: write
    address: [MAIN, 0x1A08F98]
    value_type: int32
    value: [2, 2]
```

> Cutscene detection offset

Now we need to find those bytes
```
09 01 00 39 FD 7B C3 A8 C0 03 5F D6
```

Fourth instruction above is LDR instruction that loads pointer. Piece of function looks like this:
```asm
.text:0000007100C3B824                 LDR             X8, [X8,#off_7101A28B40@PAGEOFF]
.text:0000007100C3B828                 STR             XZR, [X19,#0x8B0]
.text:0000007100C3B82C                 LDP             X20, X19, [SP,#var_s20]
.text:0000007100C3B830                 LDP             X22, X21, [SP,#var_s10]
.text:0000007100C3B834                 STRB            W9, [X8]
.text:0000007100C3B838                 LDP             X29, X30, [SP+var_s0],#0x30
.text:0000007100C3B83C                 RET
```


 Pointer is loaded from `off_7101A28B40`, which leads to `byte_7101A65958`.


So value is stored as 1 byte at `[MAIN, 0x1A65958]`.<br>
If it's not equal to 0, cutscene is played. If it's not equal to 1, cutscene is not played.

So we can write patch like this for above 30 FPS:
```yaml
  -
    type: compare
    compare_address: [MAIN, 0x1A65958]
    compare_type: "!="
    compare_value_type: int8
    compare_value: 1
    address: [MAIN, 0x1A08F98]
    value_type: int32
    value: [1, 1]
  -
    type: compare
    compare_address: [MAIN, 0x1A65958]
    compare_type: "!="
    compare_value_type: int8
    compare_value: 0
    address: [MAIN, 0x1A08F98]
    value_type: int32
    value: [2, 2]
```
