Game engine is designed only for 30 FPS. Game speed, physics, animations are all hardcoded to run at 30 FPS, so it requires many MASTER_WRITE patches to try fix it. 
Don't expect proper compability with FPSLocker like never. My endeavor ended [HERE](https://gbatemp.net/threads/animal-crossing-new-horizon-60-fps.560209/post-9029449)
